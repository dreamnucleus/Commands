Could there be an IResult, SuccessResult, and IErrorResult

What would ProcessSuccessAsync do with IResult if it is not an exception would we throw something else...

Can we auto generate Enums based on return types and use them with ProcessResultAsync

What if there is a real error then we really do need the .Catch

What about logging?

What about a pipeline, saw we want to log everything as it goes through the system...
