Could there be an IResult, SuccessResult, and IErrorResult

What would ProcessSuccessAsync do with IResult if it is not an exception would we throw something else...

Can we auto generate Enums based on return types and use them with ProcessResultAsync

What if there is a real error then we really do need the .Catch

## Different Types of commands ##
Could create a SingletonCommand which requires a lock on an internal object or external resource


## Pipelines ##
What about a pipeline, saw we want to log everything as it goes through the system...

Add in logging into the pipeline

Add in validation into the pipeline




## Noficiation - like pipelines specific for a command ##
Noficiation for a command? Could allow to process something at the start of a command and then something at success.

Create account with a client id:
  On Started -> Ignore
  On ClientIdNotFound -> queue to send an email admin about a user attempted to sign up and clientID could not be found
  On Success -> queue to send out an email to user/admin
  
Checkout of a cart:
  On Started -> Ignore
  On AnyFailure -> send to insights checkout was attempted
  On Sucess -> great!
